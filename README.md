Welcome to the Weather app

From learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the Scrimba course, I searh for easy project on youtube to have better understanding mainly for JavaScript. In the text below, I'm going to describe technologies that I implement in my code.

THE TECHNOLOGIES

HTML:
  - Creating simple structure of the page to get information about Weather.
    
CSS:

  - Style the Weather App to really simple app as possible to be easy to read and get information as fast as possible.
    
Javascript:

  - Understanding of basics variables and if else statements,
  - First time using DOM Manipulation mainly querySelectors and addEventListener to search button,
  - Also first time implementing API to my code with openweathermap.org. It was really interesting process while i was implementing it to the final version in code.

Last of all I use netlify to deploy my site to world of internet. (https://karol-weatherapp.netlify.app/)

I hope you will like this little project and if you have some advice for me what I can change or make better you can contact me via my portfolio page.

Happy Coding and See you later with my next projects!!! :)
